# BWF App Demo
This is my unofficial implementation of the LifeLineTracker App which i had developed for Borderless World Foundation.
I hosted the project on my own free server http://watertank.mooo.com 
I made this server for my water tank measurement IOT project.

The apk was not published to playstore because the organization wanted to use the app internally and not make it public.

**You may notice the DiscreteConsultants logo in both the app and web interface. It represents the sub-organization under Borderless World Foundation (BWF)
They told me to write the app and website under that logo.
